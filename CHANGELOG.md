# VIPR Emulator Changelog

## Version 0.2

- Changed the message when GL Context creation fails in all OpenGL-based renderers to use the one supplied by SDL2.

- Fixed the OpenGL 3.0 renderer as it had numerous bugs.

- Added the ability to load a custom ROM file.  As a result, you are no longer forced to supply the 'VIP.rom' file for either the operating system or a custom ROM.

- Added a new status to the Memory Transfer menu when you're about to overwrite an existing file.  All you have to do is activate the "Transfer" option the second time to overwrite the file.

- Most keys should now work with num lock turned on during input.

## Version 0.1

- Initial Release
