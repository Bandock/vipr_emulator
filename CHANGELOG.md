# VIPR Emulator Changelog

## Version 0.2

- Changed the message when GL Context creation fails in all OpenGL-based renders to use the one supplied by SDL2.

- Fixed the OpenGL 3.0 renderer as it had numerous bugs.

- Added the ability to load a custom ROM file.  As a result, you are no longer forced to supply the 'VIP.rom' file for either the operating system or a custom ROM.

## Version 0.1

- Initial Release
